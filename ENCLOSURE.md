### Comments on 3D printing materials/structures

The transparent filament does not allow clear look-through (figure below has chip depth in 1mm), if a clean look is required acrylic seems more reasonable
(in contrast this could be helpful in some cases by refraction or smoothing, like tiolet windows?).

When a surface (a 'leg') is too thin, deformation may occur. A quick fix is to heat it and bend it by applying (gentle) force. 
I think this is prominent for design with long, unsupported surface. In this case the 'leg' is supported by only a thin edge.
It would be more structually stable if it is connected by more edges or have a larger contact area.

### Fusion 360 features
<p align="justify"> 
During the term break I (finially) have time to watch the tutorial videos of <a href=https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/courses/#fusion-360-fundamentals>Fusion 360</a>.
The self-paced learning resource contains a great variety of functions, such as sketching, solid/ mesh modeling, assembling and manufacturing, designing and simulating. 
It even has a series about electronic basic and another about PCB. Many of the functions are impressive, 
especially those about direct moelling and T-splines which can twist and deform with a very large degreen of freedom. 
Another amazing tool is the generative design, which the software can generate models by itself after assigning the thresholds, constraints, and other parameters.

The geometries (circle and ellipses) on my enclosure were drawn one by one. If I have known some functions before, I can automate/duplicate the process to improve efficiency and precision.
For example, a (circular/ rectangular) pattern can be applied to generate multiple geometries on the same surface.

In addition, fillet can be applied at the sharp vertices to improve safety.
