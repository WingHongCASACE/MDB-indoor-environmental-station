# Testing of positional effects of sensors to temperature reading

<p align="justify"> 
This is a supplementary photo showing the distance (above 20 cm) measured between the temperature sensor and the gas sensor which produces heat. 
At this distance the temperature reading is 0.8 Â°C lower than when sensors were placing together.

<a href=https://lastminuteengineers.com/mq2-gas-senser-arduino-tutorial/>Last Minutes Engineers</a> give an introduction to the structure and working principle of the MQ gas sensors,
as well as to connect it to an Arduino board. Heating is needed to attract oxygen, which in turn attract electrons from tin dioxide (semiconductive material) 
away from the circult to the sensing surface and reduce circult flow. If reducing gas is present it will react with oxygen, which will free the electrons back to tin dioxide and allow
circult flow.
